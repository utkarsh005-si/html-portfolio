<h1>About Me</h1>
Hi, Iâ€™m [Utkarsh Singh] ðŸ‘‹<br>
<p>Iâ€™m a BCA student at AMC, Bangalore, passionate about full stack development. I enjoy learning and working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python, and Iâ€™ve also explored C, C++, Java, and DBMS.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m interested in building websites and applications that are user-friendly and efficient. My goal is to keep improving my coding skills and grow as a developer.</p>

<p>When Iâ€™m not coding, I like to explore new technologies, learn through projects, and stay curious about how things work.</p>
